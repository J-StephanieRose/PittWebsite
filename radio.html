    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
   
     <p>My interest in electromagnetic spectrum began four years ago. At first, I was interested in how emerging technological advancements appeared to be a driving force for policy initiatives. Since then, my focus has shifted towards how technology is being regulated and the policies enforced. This is large in part to the research I am conducting with my advisor, Dr. Martin B.H. Weiss and my fellow colleagues where we are investigating wireless automated enforcement measures â€“ from an incumbent perspective and third party regulators such as the Federal Communications Commission.  However, for this work, we are more focused on incumbents and the various types of policy implementation (through de facto and/or de jure rights). </p>
     <p>My area of interest within the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems (DINS) is the automation of spectrum policy. Thus far, my perspective on regulator needs within this area is something that is limited in terms of related literature. One of the few things that scholars within my area can agree on is that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can/should be doing a better job. Therefore, I decided to use LIS 3600, LIS 3902, and this capstone as a chance to investigate some of these spectrum issues further. </p>
     <p>My research for the Digital Studies and Methods certificate, takes a closer look into the Federal Communications Commission's role as a regulator and how they adjudicate enforcement. In order to accomplish this, I have reviewed violations - specifically focusing on spectrum violations as a subset - and used digital methods to analyze this data. This portfolio and its contents are the collective works of my year long journey.</p>

      <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
      <p>The structure of this portfolio, the DSAM presentation, and self-reflection are comprised of an overview/introduction, an explanation of the dataset (where it came from, what I had to do, and my adversities with it), a discussion of the previous iterations/ milestones (LIS 3600 & LIS 3902), my points of failure,  adopted digital methods, learning opportunities, my final iteration/milestone, overall research project limitations, my goals for future work, and my final reflection & discussion.</p>
      <P>Through this work, I have attempted to be as candid and transparent as possible. Since this capstone is based on a years' + amount of work, I relied heavily on notes and previous deliverables to provide a full narrative. Overtime, my insights, questions, and hypotheses have changed as I learned more about my data and the digital tools used to analyze it. Therefore, I apologize in advance if there are times during these products where I appear to be straddling between various milestones of this project. I know I know what I am talking about, however, I hope that it is as clear a narrative to you as it is to me. </P>

   <!-- <button class="accordion">OVERVIEW</button>
       <div class="panel">
          <p>The United States is experiencing spectrum scarcity, or so most research and initiatives would have the community believe. This argument has been the premise for several initiatives on how to best utilize and allocate radio spectrum. However, with the advent of the Internet of Things and 5G services, it has become important to take a look at the governing policy and regulatory efforts in order to develop measures on how to deal with enforcement specifically, automated enforcement for spectrum interference.</p> 
          <p>My research for this project investigates the enforcement of commercial spectrum and how the Federal Communication Commission's Enforcement Bureau adjudicates interference issues within radio frequency bands. My hypothesis is that radio spectrum interference is an important and serious issue that needs to be alleviated before emerging technologies enter the current spectrum environment. Moreover, it is possible that there is an enforcement disparity in which "would be offenders" are not necessarily dissuaded from interfering with radio spectrum. Through my research, I hope to gain a better understanding of the enforcement measures and process in order to develop an automated enforcement structure that would best encapsulate policy/ regulator needs and requirements for fair and consistent relation and enforcement of radio spectrum.</p>

   <button class="accordion">INTRODUCTION</button>
       <div class="panel">
           <p>As this is the first phase of this research project, the main questions I wanted to answer were: 
              <ol>
                 <li> How often does radio spectrum interference take place?</li>
                 <li>Who are the main offenders/violators?</li>
                 <li>What kind of interference and/or violations related to radio frequency occur?</li>
              </ol>
         Although the FCC currently has a map dedicated to enforcement of pirate radio, that is only one type of interference/violation. As radio spectrum moves to become an even more shared environment between commercial and federal users, I hope to find out what (if any) other interference/violations happen within these frequencies in order to better determine how to automate spectrum enforcement.</p>
       </div>

   <button class="accordion">THE DATASET</button>
      <div class="panel">
         <p>Since the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database is primarily html files (with all of the document content coded under "pre"), I manually investigated each of the cases (650 so far) for enforcement actions and extracted 217 radio spectrum explicit interference cases. Through the process of coding each case manually, I have realized there are implicit and explicit cases of spectrum interference. Explicit cases include enforcement actions where the frequency band the violator inteterferred with, used illegally, or intentionally blocked signals on are named outright in their case file. There are addiitonal cases that will require more research where the violator has received an enforcement, but their document only states that they interfered with, used, or blocked radio frequencies (sometimes with public safety bands) and no actual frequency band has been documented. Cases of this ilk will be designated as spectrum implicit during the second phase of my research. It appears that this may be a lack of standard (or lack of adhered standard) across the different enforcement bureaus (which cover regions 1, 2, 3 and the FCC Headquarters in D.C.). Each manually coded case for enforcement (whether radio interference explicit/implicit or not) was coded into a spreadsheet. Attributes that I captured included Name of violator, case number (linked to the original html document on the FCC transition.fcc.gov website), date of violation, location, frequency (what frequency they interfered with and/or transmitted on illegally), enforcement type (e.g. warning, notice of violation, penalty (with fine if appropriate), publication (e.g. NOV, FOUO, Consent Decree, Forfeiture, etc.), entity type (e.g. business, individual, duo, religious establishment, or educational institution), enforcement bureau dept region, enforcement bureau department location, and whether or not the violator was a license holder at the time of their offense (which was annotated in their case file).</p>  
         <p>After collecting the preliminary data (2017 enforcement cases), I reviewed various digital tools in order to find one that would enable me to not only geographically show where radio interference and enforcement are taking place, but also allow me to provide context to each case. Unfortunately, I had to eliminate tools such as ArcGIS, ColorBrewer, and Scribble Maps due to the time constraints, user error, and not really being able to fully provide the details I felt were important to analyze and contextualize the dynamics between interference and enforcement. Eventually, I ended up with a mock up version which was created using Google Maps. By utilizing Google Maps to begin to actualize what data I want to investigate further, I was able to upload and create several layers for different years of enforcement. Since each year of enforcement action varies by color, it is much easier to assess possible trends or "hot spots" for interference.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, I completed a brief analysis on the data I have collected thus far. Although these are only initial results, they appear to be showing trends which may lead to additional questions in the second phase and provide a better understanding of the violators/interference cases, but also the manner in which the FCC handles them.</p>

   <button class="accordion">PREVIOUS ITERATIONS</button>
      <div class="panel">
     
       <p><i>FIRST MILESTONE - LIS 3600 | FALL 2017</i></p>
        <p>When I began this project in 2017, my main question was "is interference a big issue for spectrum enforcement?". My secondary question posited who the main offenders are/were and where these violations/ types of interference typically occur.</p>
    <p>During fall 2017, my initial results regarding the data I informed me that only 100 cases out of the data collected were spectrum specific. The main offenders during this first phase were individuals and more often than not, their violation was priate radio - primary location for this type of violation, Florida. At this time, in my research, my points of failure - otherwise termed, limitations - included lack of knowledge regarding GIS tools, time constraints, lack of computer space, and being unfamiliar with the FCC's retention of records.</p>
   <p>By spring 2018, my project goals had shifted. Although I was still interested in the primary question - how big of a deal is interference? and my secondary question of what type, who, and where is this interference occurring? - my project goals for the second phase were focused on data collection (and from a more fine-grained view consistency and clarity of data collection) and familiarizing myself with other GIS tools so that my research output would be more than "dots on a map" as Dr. Langmead likes to say.</p>
   <p>Now that I am in my third phase of data, as of 08 October 2018; my project goals are to clean the data - as I have collected over 8000 FCC EB records - and continue working familiarizing myslef with other GIS tools in order to fully portray what is occurring within the enforcement sphere regarding spectrum interference violations.</p>

      <h3>CAPTA-Vated Audience: Utilizing GIS to Analyze Radio Spectrum Enforcement</h3>
      <h5><justify> This research project aims to analyze existing spectrum enforcement through the use of geographic information systems (GIS). By "mapping" enforcement, I hope to gain new insight on how regulatory authorities, polickymakers, and violaters interact within the spectrum landscape (past and present). The overarching goal of this research will be to design a system for automated enforcement from a regulatory authority perspective (Policy as a Service - PaaS). Additionally, once conceptualized, continuing research will investigate how beneficial a service like this could be in IoT enriched and 5G environments.</justify></h5>

   <p>MILESTONE I - Spectrum Specific Interference and Enforcement</p>
    
  </div>

  <!-- End Projects grid -->
         <p>Based on the 2017 data extracted and visualized using Google Fusion Tables, spectrum interference does not appear to be the epidemic one might envision. Main offenders appear to be individuals operating unlicensed operations from residential areas. Additionally, it seems that majority of the offenders are located on the east and west coasts. Majority of the offenses are unlicensed operation notices. Based on the data, violations from businesses and/or major service providers were limited or non-existent.</p> 
 
         <p><i>Initial Results â€“ Phase I</i></p>  
         <p>Upon further research (2014-2016), one of the most prominent factors while traversing the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database is that there are many types of violations (some that directly hinder/ interfere with other licensee's), while other infractions are violations of the licensees' agreement (e.g. breach of contract). Overall there are a myriad of violators for pirate radio, exceeding power limits, and expired licenses (sometimes for years). All of these actions contribute to the towards radio frequency interference.</p>

    <p>Shooting Bling: When I began this project, I wasnt sure what information I would find, how it was maintained by the FCC, and how (or if) I would even find what I was looking for.</p>
   
    <p><img src="https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jsr67_pitt_edu/Ecsr0uUTPlRJtDHsVoUS50MBhLMYXcD0FpTz4HP_REOwuQ?e=SYKkDq" width="450" height="320" align="middle" h border="5">More data collection and now cleaning the data</p>
    <p>Cleaning up my data mess: After gaining a better understanding of what information was provided by the FCC EB database, I was able to make more informed decisions on how to best collect, "code", and create my own respository for the information I needed.</p>
   
    <p><img src="https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jsr67_pitt_edu/ETR91s8j5pxBk4dFkCYX494B-THbyxvZs-5LsJzkuzNP7g?e=EjGWFS" width="450" height="320" align="middle" h border="5">A tool.</p>
    <p>Finding the Right Tool: During the initial phase of my research I looked at a few different tools. Some where too simplistic and didnt afford enough flexibility to provide the lecel of context I needed to work alongside the GIS I wanted to utilize. Other tools were too code heavy and I didnt feel as though I would be able to work through it in enough time to really get any tangible use out of them. What did stick was Google Maps...but they had their own affordances and drawbacks.</p>
   
    <p><img src="https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jsr67_pitt_edu/EcgovqXaYxNHrZ5H6VA4Vl0B7pYjudZKVx2RRLMSNwnmHQ?e=foe5xy" width="450" height="320" align="middle" h border="5">Thou Shalt Not Covet...but lets face it, this is cool!</p>
    <p>Urghhh: This term, I came across an example of how I wanted my content and the geographic visualization of my dataset to work. I felt as though this way the best marriage of information and visualization that could represent what I want to convey in my research to the general population as well as academics.</p>

    <p>Got Me Going in Circles: So for this phase of my research, after collecting more data (now 10 years worth of commercial radio spectrum violations), cleaning the data to something more comprehensible, and transferring my efforts from Google Maps to Tableau...I now realize, my Tableau isnt looking too different from my original efforts for GIS. Additionally, they most certainly dont look like the Guardians work.</p>
