    <h3> Preliminary Exam</h3>
     <h3>Designing Automated Enforcement for Telecommunications Policy</h3>
     <h4>Abstract</h4>
     <p>Spectrum scarcity has been the foundation of several arguments as to why innovative spectrum management initiatives are needed. Subsequently, the resolutions for spectrum management in an attempt to circumvent “scarcity” has pointedly been centralized towards optimizing spectrum allocation. By approaching spectrum management in this linear manner, efforts to alleviate spectrum management issues at the regulatory authority level have been limited if not non-existent. Whilst focusing on spectrum allocation as an ex-ante enforcement measure – which typically encompasses actions such as Spectrum Access Systems, the infrastructure and legal framework of this enforcement are often overlooked.</p>
     <p>There has been much discussion regarding whether it is best to take an ex ante or ex post approach to spectrum regulation and subsequent enforcement. However, we rarely delve into the in eventus (during an event) actions that would need to be implemented to ensure spectrum infractions aren't falling by the wayside. But how can we best accomplish this? Additionally, how are regulatory authorities supposed to maintain oversight of automated enforcement structures for incumbents, radio frequency interference, and/or schemes promoted for shared spectrum environments when the regulators do not have an automated enforcement structure capable of interfacing with those types of innovations? This research focuses on designing an automated enforcement scheme that strives to find a solution to implement a more in eventus enforcement framework for spectrum sharing at the regulatory authority level.</p>

    <h3> Comprehensive Exam</h3>
     <h3>Leveraging GIS to Gain a Different Perspective on Current Issues in Telecommunications</h3>
     <h4>Abstract</h4>
     <p>GIS has many applications within the field of Information Sciences – and by extension Telecommunications. Whether a researcher is attempting to gain insight to the spread of a new computer virus, the increase of smart grids/ expansion of smart cities, the spread of blockchain enabled devices, location of towers, or service coverage, GIS can be leveraged in order to obtain an additional perspective to the analyzation of data.</p>
     <p>This tutorial on GIS provides a foundation on how to utilize existing methods and techniques implemented by primary GIS fields such as geography, law, history, etc. and apply them towards themes that are prevalent within today’s telecommunications society. Beginning with a brief description and history of GIS, this guide then segues into considerations such as relevant topics and considerations when utilizing GIS such as whether to use a more raster or vector approach, data collection of primary and secondary sources, tool selection – paid, subscription, or free?, creating a database vs using excel (and whether the selected tool has the option to create a database within its program), result output, project consideration – when is it done?, and how these processes can bolster one’s research within the field of computing and information sciences – specifically, Telecommunications.</p>
     <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should have an understanding of how to collect, conceptualize, and organize your data, upload/implement your data into a GIS application, manipulate, analyze, and show your results, determine project longevity (should this be forever?) and convey your findings both within an online environment and real-world. Overall, you should end with an understanding of what GIS is, how to leverage it within your research.</p>
     <P>This tutorial is still in progress, so please stay tuned as there is more to come!</P>

     <h3>Teaching-as-Research Project | Pitt-CIRTL</h3>
     <p>Group projects are an essential learning mechanism - especially within large classroom environments. When considering active learning and innovative pedagogical approaches, this research aims to get a better understanding of how professors implement and utilize group projects to meet learning objectives. In order to accomplish this, I have constructed a survey that is being dissimenated to STEM instructors that are currently teaching at the University of Pittsburgh. The overarching goal is to understand the current practices surrounding group projects in STEM and eventually devise mediation - if necessary - to utilize best practices that can maximize the assimilation of learnig objectives when implementing group projects within the classroom.<p>

     <h3>Telecom Policy, Regulation, & Enforcement - Radio Spectrum | Digital Studies and Methods Certificate</h3>
     <p>More often than not, research within my field - Information Sciences - typically results in quantitative analysis, algorithmic design, or some sort of computational output. When I began my first DSAM course in fall 2017, I was encouraged to engage my research in a way where I needed to reflect not only on the implications of the results, but also why and what digital methods I selected to choose and provide justification for the ones I didnt. During my time within the DSAM course curriculum, I decided to analyze spectrum regulation and enforcement spacially, as well as investigate other digital tools and methods that I didn't know existed. By approaching my research in this manner, I have gained a deeper understanding and have become more inquisitve about my data, methodoligical approach, and my overall research topic.</p>

<button class="accordion">Overview</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The United States is experiencing spectrum scarcity, or so most research and initiatives would have the community believe. This argument has been the premise for several initiatives on how to best utilize and allocate radio spectrum. However, with the advent of the Internet of Things and 5G services, it has become important to take a look at the governing policy and regulatory efforts in order to develop measures on how to deal with enforcement specifically, automated enforcement for spectrum interference.</p> 
   <p>My research for this project investigates the enforcement of commercial spectrum and how the Federal Communication Commission's Enforcement Bureau adjudicates interference issues within radio frequency bands. My hypothesis is that radio spectrum interference is an important and serious issue that needs to be alleviated before emerging technologies enter the current spectrum environment. Moreover, it is possible that there is an enforcement disparity in which "would be offenders" are not necessarily dissuaded from interfering with radio spectrum. Through my research, I hope to gain a better understanding of the enforcement measures and process in order to develop an automated enforcement structure that would best encapsulate policy/ regulator needs and requirements for fair and consistent relation and enforcement of radio spectrum.</p>
  </div>


<button class="accordion">Research Questions</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>As this is the first phase of this research project, the main questions I wanted to answer were: 
      <ol>
        <li> How often does radio spectrum interference take place?</li>
        <li>Who are the main offenders/violators?</li>
        <li>What kind of interference and/or violations related to radio frequency occur?</li>
      </ol>
Although the FCC currently has a map dedicated to enforcement of pirate radio, that is only one type of interference/violation. As radio spectrum moves to become an even more shared environment between commercial and federal users, I hope to find out what (if any) other interference/violations happen within these frequencies in order to better determine how to automate spectrum enforcement.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Methodology</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Since the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database is primarily html files (with all of the document content coded under "pre"), I manually investigated each of the cases (650 so far) for enforcement actions and extracted 217 radio spectrum explicit interference cases. Through the process of coding each case manually, I have realized there are implicit and explicit cases of spectrum interference. Explicit cases include enforcement actions where the frequency band the violator inteterferred with, used illegally, or intentionally blocked signals on are named outright in their case file. There are addiitonal cases that will require more research where the violator has received an enforcement, but their document only states that they interfered with, used, or blocked radio frequencies (sometimes with public safety bands) and no actual frequency band has been documented. Cases of this ilk will be designated as spectrum implicit during the second phase of my research. It appears that this may be a lack of standard (or lack of adhered standard) across the different enforcement bureaus (which cover regions 1, 2, 3 and the FCC Headquarters in D.C.). Each manually coded case for enforcement (whether radio interference explicit/implicit or not) was coded into a spreadsheet. Attributes that I captured included Name of violator, case number (linked to the original html document on the FCC transition.fcc.gov website), date of violation, location, frequency (what frequency they interfered with and/or transmitted on illegally), enforcement type (e.g. warning, notice of violation, penalty (with fine if appropriate), publication (e.g. NOV, FOUO, Consent Decree, Forfeiture, etc.), entity type (e.g. business, individual, duo, religious establishment, or educational institution), enforcement bureau dept region, enforcement bureau department location, and whether or not the violator was a license holder at the time of their offense (which was annotated in their case file).</p>  
    <p>After collecting the preliminary data (2017 enforcement cases), I reviewed various digital tools in order to find one that would enable me to not only geographically show where radio interference and enforcement are taking place, but also allow me to provide context to each case. Unfortunately, I had to eliminate tools such as ArcGIS, ColorBrewer, and Scribble Maps due to the time constraints, user error, and not really being able to fully provide the details I felt were important to analyze and contextualize the dynamics between interference and enforcement. Eventually, I ended up with a mock up version which was created using Google Maps. By utilizing Google Maps to begin to actualize what data I want to investigate further, I was able to upload and create several layers for different years of enforcement. Since each year of enforcement action varies by color, it is much easier to assess possible trends or "hot spots" for interference.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I completed a brief analysis on the data I have collected thus far. Although these are only initial results, they appear to be showing trends which may lead to additional questions in the second phase and provide a better understanding of the violators/interference cases, but also the manner in which the FCC handles them.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Results</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p><i>Preliminary Results</i></p>
<p>Based on the 2017 data extracted and visualized using Google Fusion Tables, spectrum interference does not appear to be the epidemic one might envision. Main offenders appear to be individuals operating unlicensed operations from residential areas. Additionally, it seems that majority of the offenders are located on the east and west coasts. Majority of the offenses are unlicensed operation notices. Based on the data, violations from businesses and/or major service providers were limited or non-existent.</p> 
 
<p><i>Initial Results – Phase I</i></p>  
<p>Upon further research (2014-2016), one of the most prominent factors while traversing the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database is that there are many types of violations (some that directly hinder/ interfere with other licensee's), while other infractions are violations of the licensees' agreement (e.g. breach of contract). Overall there are a myriad of violators for pirate radio, exceeding power limits, and expired licenses (sometimes for years). All of these actions contribute to the towards radio frequency interference.</p>

<button class="accordion">Discussion</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Although my research will not include the federal spectrum element (due to lack of resources, availability/ accessibility of information, and time), finding out what interference/violations are prevalent within commercial spectrum will be a promising start to developing requirements of an automated system and infrastructure.  
Additionally, since the FCC is no longer maintaining their spectrum database, my research will aid in realizing the typical "hot spots" for interference (and recurring types of interference). By completing this project, other researchers may be able to gain a better idea of who the repeat offenders are, what types of violations/ interference these violators are prone to within shared spectrum spaces, which states are most likely to have/receive interference, etc.</p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">Future Research</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The benefits of this research are that it is current and provides a guide (and hopefully if developed further, a roadmap) of how we can begin to automate spectrum enforcement. The next steps of this project will be to finish coding 1999-2013 of the FCC Enforcement Bureau's database, utilize a more permanent GIS tool with the functionality to show where spectrum is occurring while also allowing various content and attributes specific to each case, analyze the data in its entirety (1999-2017), and begin establishing system requirements in order to develop automated spectrum enforcement for policy as a service (PaaS).</p>

<button class="accordion">LIS 3600 - What This Course Demonstrated to Me</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>I am still the headstrong individual my parents wished I would eventually grow up and not be. Originally when I selected this topic/direction for this course, I thought my captaset would be a fair amount of work, prep, etc. However, I have come to terms that this research project is highly ambitious and I may have "bitten off more than I can chew". Yet, if there is one thing this course has demonstrated to me, it's that grappling with your data, your tools, and questioning yourself at every turn is essentially the life blood of what most digital humanists - not the crazy ones that did the music research - go through. If the answers and the tools were easy or a "quick fix" would what we are researching really be that important or have an impact? I look forward to working on phase two of my research and seeing what happens next.</p>
